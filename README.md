# cool-birds

bevy/csgrs port of the amazing OpenSCAD script for generating bird models to 3d print, [Bird-o-matic by MoonCactus](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:139945/files)

open up [the site](https://coolbirds.website) or download a release for your machine to start building your own birds

## pillars
- make cool birds
- small to no input on bird generation outside of preference (does the user think bird is good or bad?)
- make cool birds easy & fun to share

## features
- generate random birds
  - 'iterate' on birds, selecting your preferred bird from generated progeny
- copy a bird seed (text representation of bird)
- paste a bird seed

[pls share any god birds you make!](https://github.com/sambskn/coolbirds/discussions/9) - will try to add them to the set of initial 'good birds' to pick from!
